# Image-to-webp-converter-simple-script
Just a simple script to turn any image into a webp file type image
* The script uses [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp), a google made webp file render engine.
* The script will install cwebp if not installed already
* The script REQUIRES Homebrew in order to install [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp)
* Script tested only on MacOS

Simple usage, just drag or paste image into terminal and thats it, new webp file will show in image directory with same name.
